This is my personal web page. It includes my previous experiences, projects and hobbies.

## Let me see it!

Just [go to my website](https://falopez10.github.io/)

## Technologies used

* **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: My favorite javascript framework so far. I used create-react-app just to get the basis folder structure.
* **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: Really simple to use and to learn either if you know JS or not.
* **[Material-ui](https://material-ui.com/)**: As I love tweaking my apps with CSS and native resources, I recomend this highly-customizable library to save time developing react apps.
* **CSS**: Along with [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) and [jss](https://cssinjs.org/), I believe the language used for styling will keep being the standard in web development.
* **[snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/)**: An interesting alternative to webpack and other building tools. I used to configure webpack from scratch to generate the static web files needed, but in terms of dev experience I believe snowpack is better and still lets you customize your building processes as much as you want.
* **gh-pages**: Currently I serve the webpage on github pages.

## Initial setup

### snowpack template

npm install --save-dev snowpack

npx create-snowpack-app new-dir --template @snowpack/app-template-react-typescript

### Additional steps

That's it! If you need an specific version of typescript or are using some version of react *(I had some trouble using the new JSX syntax available since React 17.0.0)* with certain features you may need to add plugins to snowpack, which is pretty easy to use.
